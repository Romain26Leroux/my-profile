        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
         I'm a big football since I was five. I support PSG as I come from Paris.
         On top of that I played football in team for 12 years.
         I played 4 years guitar and 7 years piano.
         When I am on holidays I surf, ski and snowboard.

        <h2>Languages</h2>
        <p>
         I currently speak 4 languages; French, German, English and Spanish.
         French is my mothertongue, which I speak at home.
         I learned german as I lived there 12 years. Most of my friends are german, hence I speak it fluently.
         English is my third language, which I learned while I stayed at the International School of DÃ¼sseldorf for 4 years. 
         It is now the language I speak during my studies.
         Last but not least I study Spanish since 8 years. I did many trips to Spain to practice. I am not fluent yet but almost.
